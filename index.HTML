<h2>Sailing</h2>
<p>
Currently, my number 1 favorite sport is <strong>sailing</strong>. I have been sailing since I was <em>9 years old</em> in the US every summer and it's a great skill to learn.
Despite the fact that weather conditions can be rough, I have always had a pleasant experience on my sailboat. Overall, sailing is quite difficult, but when you learn the basics, it becomes really fun.

<h2>Football</h2>
<p>
My second favorite sport is <strong>football</strong>. I find this sport intense but also fun because no matter how good you are, there are always more skills to learn.
I also have a football pitch in my compound, making it easier for me to advance in the sport. All in all, I am very passionate about football, but I find it quite repetitive.
