    <h1>My Favorite Sports</h1>
<h2>Sailing</h1>
<p>
Currently, my number 1 favorite sport is sailing. I have been sailing since I was 9 years old in the US every summer and it's a great skill to learn.
Despite the fact that weather conditions can be rough, I have always had a pleasant experience on my sailboat. Overall, sailing is quite difficult, but when you learn the basics, it becomes really fun.
